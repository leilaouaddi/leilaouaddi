<dd><p>Soooooo I hate talking about myself and to be honest I don't even know what I like. I'm a very much go with the flow person. I like to try new things and experience a bunch of different things. I like so many different things like reading, writing short stories, going on walks, hanging out with my friends, etc. </p><dd>

<dd><p> I wish I could talk about classes I've taken before. Majority of my college experience has been virtual so its hard to register anything the past 4 years have been a blur for me.</p><dd>

<dd><p>I'm on the board for two organizations. I'm the communications director for the Society of Women Engineers and also Vice President for Cyber Defense Club. I want to enter the cybersecurity field and truly enjoy it. I think I work best under high pressure situations and enjoy the adrenaline rush.</p><dd>
